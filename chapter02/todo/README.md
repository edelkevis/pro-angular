# Notes

1. The class keyword is used to define types that can be instantiated with the new keyword to create objects that have well-defined data and behavior.
2. To display the data values in the model to the user. In Angular, this is done using a template, which is a fragment of HTML that contains instructions that are performed by Angular.
3. An Angular component is responsible for managing a template and providing it with the data and logic it needs.
